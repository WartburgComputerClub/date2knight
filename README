# Date 2 Knight

Date2Knight is an open-source matchmaking web application. It was originally created for the Wartburg Computer Club's fundraising activities. It works by comparing similarities between people based on a survey. If you are the curious math type, the algorithm is a n-dimension euclidean distance, the very same used by commercial dating sites.
